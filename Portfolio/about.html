            <p>Hi, I’m a BTech student specializing in Aritifical Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
            I’m passionate about technology, coding, and problem-solving, with a keen interest in areas of real time applications, data structures, and algorithms. 
            I have experience working with languages such as C++, Python, and Java, and I’m constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow.
            Through academic projects and personal initiatives, I’ve developed a solid foundation in programming and enjoy applying my knowledge to real-world challenges.
            I’m excited to explore new technologies and collaborate on innovative solutions that can make a difference.</p>
